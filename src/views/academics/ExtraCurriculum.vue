                            In addition, students with offer of admission into Year 7 are also encouraged to attend the Summer School for purposes of acclimatization since majority of the students coming into Year 7 would be leaving home for the first time.

                            School trips are an essential part of the educational experience for many students. They provide opportunities for learning, exploration and growth that can be found nowhere else. Every parent wants the best for their children, but there may be some hesitation when it comes to allowing them to go on school trips. 
                            School trips are an excellent opportunity for students to get to know their classmates and teachers on a deeper level. By spending time together in a different environment, children learn how to better communicate with each other and build relationships that will last well beyond the trip. Allowing your child to go on a school trip is beneficial in many ways,these are listed below:

                            At British Lighthouse we give students high opportunity of travelling abroad together, this create memories that will last long after the trip itself is over. Children will have to not only pack their belongings but also navigate an airport and altogether this really builds there independence and life skills. Whether itâ€™s bonding with friends or discovering something new, these experiences leave an imprint on children that will stay with them for years to come.
                        </p>

                            Allowing your child to go on school trips can open doors for both education and personal growth. While it may be daunting to let your child go away on a trip, the benefits that come with these experiences are priceless. With the proper care and preparation, school trips can be beneficial for everyone involved.
